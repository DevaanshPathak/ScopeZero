### 🕐 Hour 1: Idea’s Locked, Time to Geek Out on the ADC

Alright, first things first—had to nail down the actual idea. I’m talking a no-nonsense, open-source oscilloscope, centered around that trusty AD9280, sampling at a spicy 100 MS/s. Spent a solid chunk of time squinting at the AD9280 datasheet (who writes these things, honestly?)—figuring out what the analog input wants, how the clock’s supposed to behave, and which pins I can totally ignore without blowing things up. Jotted down notes about all the digital outputs and how to not make a mess when talking to a microcontroller. Sticking to 3.3V everywhere 'cause, really, why complicate my life?

### 🕑 Hour 2: ESP32

So, I was gonna roll with the RP2040 at first, but—plot twist—not enough GPIOs and no real high-speed parallel mojo. Had to bail and grab the ESP32 instead. It’s got that sweet parallel camera input thing and built-in USB too, which is kinda handy. Mapped D0–D7 to GPIOs 10–17, slapped SDA/SCL onto 8/9, and gave CAM_PCLK to GPIO 18. Doodled a block diagram that only makes sense to me, then scribbled down how the ADC and microcontroller would actually shake hands. Spent a lot of time reading datasheets. :cryin:

### 🕒 Hour 3: Schematic Workout

Cracked open EasyEDA and started hacking together the schematic. Dropped in that ESP32-S3-WROOM module, realized AD9280 wasn’t in the library (of course), so made my own footprint. Threw in some basic caps, power rails, and breakouts. Found a crystal for the ADC clock, piped 3.3V everywhere that mattered. Wired up the ADC digital outputs and set up the interface for the ESP32. Basically—wires everywhere, but it’s starting to look like something.

### 🕓 Hour 4: Components mainly OLED and GPIO

Time for the “boring but necessary” stuff: tossed in decoupling caps (100nF and 10uF, because why not both?), 4.7k pull-ups for I2C, and a resistor for the buzzer. Hooked up the OLED (I2C, 128x64—classic) to GPIO 8/9, with the appropriate pull-ups. Wired the buzzer to GPIO 18 and added a solder jumper so you can shut it up if it gets annoying. Double-checked for pin conflicts—none, by some miracle. Tagged unused ADC pins with NC flags so nothing floats into chaos.

### 🕔 Hour 5: ERC Warnings

Ran ERC and, not gonna lie, got a bunch of angry red squiggles. Spent a while fixing those. Double-checked every weird, unused AD9280 pin—stuff like DNC, MODE, CLAMPIN, OTR, REFSENSE, REFTF, and so on—slapped NC flags on or grounded where needed (STBY says hi). Made sure every power pin’s got decoupling, and no important signal is just… dangling. Tidied up random symbol rotations and overlapping wires so it doesn’t look like spaghetti.

### 🕕 Hour 6: PCB Layouts

Jumped into PCB mode. Started shoving parts around, trying to keep the ESP32 and ADC as close as possible for those short, dreamy traces. Split analog and digital zones so the noise doesn’t trash my signals. Snuck the caps right next to their chips like a paranoid parent. Dropped in mounting holes and added some breakouts for the ADC data lines. Kept USB, I2C, and high-current power rails away from each other—because, yeah, noise sucks. Routing? Eh, that’s tomorrow-me’s problem. For now, just making sure everything fits and the footprints don’t overlap.

### 🕖 Hour 7: Finilasing PCB

Flipped over to 2D and 3D views to make sure nothing’s floating in the aether or colliding. Exported the schematic as a PNG and snapped a 3D render of the PCB (looks way fancier than it is). Banged out a quick `README.md`. Gave the schematic one more paranoid look, then finished routing.
